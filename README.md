<h2> Technologies Used : </h2>

1. React Js : a JS library created and maintained by Facebook. This library is the core of the project. It provides tons of pre-built components to start a project which makes it easier to manage and scale the application. I used React for this application as it makes the application very easier to scale and manage by spliting up the application into small and resuable components that can be used at multiple places in the application.
2. React-Redux : a React tool to manage the state in an application by creating a store. So, Redux helps in creating a gloabal enviornment for react application which can be used to store frequently used data in a state using 'useDispatch' and can be used at any component of application using 'useSelector'.
3. Firebase : a NO-SQL database service provider which does a lot more than just providing the database storag(in this case, providing OAuth authentication). Like React, Firebase is the next easy to use and easy to manage techonology in my list. Unlike most of the other databases Firebase allows CRUD functionalities to be managed from the UI itself just by calling the inbuilt Firebase functions/pacakages/hooks. 
4. React-Firebase Hooks : a NPM package that makes firebase DB calls much more simpler with less code.
5. Styled Components : a NPM package which lets programmer to style the components much in a much cleaner way than the traditional way of assinging classes the divs.
6. Material UI : a React-UI framework which helps to use inbuilt styling for the components.
7. NPM : package manager for the project.
